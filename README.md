# Titanic_Survival_Predictor

The main aim of this project is to predict the survival chances of passengers on the Titanic based on various features available in the dataset. This involves:

1)Data Exploration and Cleaning: Understanding and preparing the data, handling missing values, and engineering relevant features.

2)Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting features that are most predictive of survival, such as family size, social class, and other demographic details.

3)Model Training: Applying various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models and train them on the dataset.

4)Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of different models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine which model best predicts survival.

5)Visualization: Using visual tools to gain insights into the data and model performance, such as survival distributions, correlation heatmaps, and feature importance.
